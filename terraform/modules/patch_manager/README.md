# AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager Module

- Use this module to set up a patch schedule for instances.
- Register instances to patch by giving the `target_tag` map the tag name and value of the instance that requires patching.
- Successful patches will be picked up from the development environment and referenced by the other environments
- Instances that require patching require the `PatchBucketAccessPolicy` added to their role. This role also needs to be trusted by the bucket in the module.
