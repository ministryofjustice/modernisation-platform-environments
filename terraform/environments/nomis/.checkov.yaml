  - CKV_AWS_189 # skip "Ensure EBS Volume is encrypted by KMS using a customer managed Key (CMK)". This is low severity, volumes are encrypted with default aws/ebs key.  CMK would allow more granular control that we probably don't need.
  - CKV_SECRET_6 # skip "Base64 High Entropy String". This is a false positive, powershell is not exposing these secrets to the console.
