#Troubleshooting this cloudformation - find logs in SSM run command window and in cloudwatch
#If erroring Check CW to see if registering a instance to a domain fails because it already exists, then remove computer from AD to allow it to be re-registered

####Warning### 
#- this cloudformation takes at least 40mins to run also it takes hours for the certs to fully propagate, so ldaps may not work for a while
#- Also remember when testing using ldp.exe to use the dns name. EG i2n.com 636 and ssl enabled
