### **Description:**

The Wardship Registers is a non-critical business application that allows Royal Courts of Justice High Court authorised staff to view wardship entries previously created within the application. Wardship applications can still be issued by the High Court, however there is no longer any requirement to record and process Wardship applications. There are occasional requests for searches on the Wardship Registers application for historic applications.
