## Mandatory Information

### **Last review date:**

### **Description:**

CCMS-SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) acts as the service bus for CCMS. The application runs in an AWS ECS Cluster using manually configured, ECS-Optimised, EC2 Instances as it's underlying compute. These instances are provisioned via an Auto Scaling Group and deployed using a Launch Template and associated User Data boot script.

SOA operates in a client-server arrangement with a single _Admin Server_ on it's own EC2 instance, running a single container and a variable number of _Enterprise Management Servers_, often referred to as simply _Managed Servers_. These managed servers may run across a variable amount of individual EC2 instances and a variable amount of containers, spread across these instances.

For an architecture diagram, see the [LLD in the central architecture diagram repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-architectural-diagrams/blob/main/docs/diagrams/lld/ccms/ccms-soa.png).

### **Databases:**

The application is backed by two RDS (Oracle) databases:

**SOA-DB:**

This is a custom DB used by Document Service SOA composite for caching documents before making calls to CCMS-EBS. The reason behind this is SOA is configured to retry in the event of any error while invoking EBS PL/SQL stored procedure to insert documents. Typical usage is when PUI and Apply applications submit documents to CCMS-EBS via SOA.

**TDS-DB:**

This database is essential for the SOA system to inject documents that are ultimately transmitted to NEC (Northgate).
Previously, the database was tightly coupled with the SOA infrastructure.
However, it has since been decoupled and is now managed under the ownership of the EDRMS application.

Given that EDRMS is the primary stakeholder of this database, EDRMS should ideally be deployed first.
The database should be initialized using the scripts provided in the EDRMS environment.
Additionally, the necessary configuration details—such as the JDBC URL, username, and password—should be stored in a secret, which can then be referenced by the SOA WebLogic cluster through its datasource binding.

### **Storage:**

Application state is held on an EFS storage volume, this is mounted to the ECS clusters EC2 Instances as part of their boot process and exposed to the running containers.

### **Hosting environment:**

### **Automatic alerts:**

Alerting will be sent to the following slack channels:

- `#laa-alerts-ccms-soa-nonprod`
- `#laa-alerts-ccms-soa-prod`

Depending on environment. Alerts are based on Cloudwatch Metric filters, and are relayed on as Cloudwatch Alarms being tripped, relayed via SNS to Amazon Q (Chatbot).

Alerts include infrastructure level monitoring for compute overconsumption as well as application level issues such unavailable endpoints. Rather than attempt to list all metric filters and alarms in this document (as they will evolve over time), see the configurations in code [here](./logs.tf) for metric filters and [here](./alerting.tf) for alarms.

**NOTE ON MONITORING COMPOSITE ENDPOINTS**

Composite endpoints are individually monitored by SOA by an internal process and the outcomes of their checks relayed on to the same Cloudwatch alerting mechanism described above.

A list of custom endpoints (which includes all composites that need to be managed) is defined in a file named `paths_to_check.txt` at the root of the shared EFS volume for each environment. This file is stored in the `laa-ccms-soa-app` and is loaded on to the EFS filesystem as part of the EC2 boot script for each instance.

If a composite is taken offline, this will result in errors being fired, to remove an endpoint from constant monitoring, simply remove it from the `paths_to_check.txt` file. These changes take effect in real time and do not require a restart of any services, containers or underlying hosts.
