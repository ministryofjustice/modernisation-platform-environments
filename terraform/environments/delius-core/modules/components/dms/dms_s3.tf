# We use an S3 bucket for staging DMS Replication data between different environments.
# Within Modernisation Platform it is not possible for a DMS instance to have endpoints within
# different accounts.  However it IS possible for S3 buckets to be readable/writeable from 
# other accounts.
# Therefore as a workaround we use S3 to stage DMS replication data between accounts.
# A DMS Instance in a source account will have a source endpoint in the local account's database and 
# a target endpoint on an S3 bucket in the target account.
# A DMS Instance in a target account will have a target endpoint in the local account's S3
# bucket and a target endpoint in the local account's database.
# We share the S3 bucket to allow this data to be replicated between accounts.
# Therefore each account must have a single S3 bucket used for staging during DMS replication.
#
# Note that we use a fixed bucket_name rather than the bucket_prefix since it is complicated
# to identify the names of buckets in other accounts if they contain random suffixes
