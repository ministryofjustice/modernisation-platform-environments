# We need to be able to detect non-working days to avoid toggling FSFO on those dates.
# Non-working days for Probation are stored in the DELIUS_APP_SCHEMA.R_STANDARD_REFERENCE_LIST
# table.   However it is not possible to query this if the database is down (for
# example, when it IS a non-working day).   Therefore we copy this data into a DynamoDB table
# where it is accessible at all times.
# We only need one copy of this table per environment, (suffixes are: db = delius-core, mis = delius-mis)
