# Allow the AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole role to be passed to the instance roles.
# We use Backup Vault to manage EC2 snapshots for Oracle hosts as these are only created sporadically, 
# e.g. ahead of a service release, and will therefore not be continually overwritten.  Writing them to a
# backup vault allows them to timeout without being overwritten.
# The AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole managed by AWS and is documented at: 
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/iam-service-roles.html
