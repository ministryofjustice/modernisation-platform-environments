## Contributing code

### Terraform Versions

We use Hashicorp [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deliver Infrastructure-as-Code.

We stay up-to-date with the latest versions of Terraform, but with Terraform Providers the Modernisation Platform Team control the version in use.

### Tests

Our versioned Terraform modules have unit tests; these are written using [Terratest](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest#section-readme) and Google Go.

Your branch should ensure that changes you have made are reflected in the tests, and that these unit tests pass before raising a Pull Request.

A GitHub Action will automatically run tests against your Pull Request once you have raised it.

### Versioning

Where appropriate, versioning is based on your commit messages by using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Our [Modernisation Platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/) and [Modernisation Platform Environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/) repositories are deployed with CI/CD from the _main_ branch, and thus are not versioned.

Terraform modules which are used by the [Modernisation Platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/) and [Modernisation Platform Environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/) repositories
are versioned using GitHub Tags and Releases following Semantic Versioning.

When you come to raise a pull request, please explain the context for your pull request so that your changes are easier to understand.

### Release

Releases are actioned by the Modernisation Platform team.
