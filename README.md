## Introduction

This repository contains the Modernisation Platform infrastructure and workflow for user environments (AWS accounts). 

Here you can add infrastructure to your environment with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). This currently is manually deployed to your environment by a Modernisation Platform engineer, but we plan to introduce Github workflows to automate this.

To learn more about how the Modernisation Platform works, please see our main repo [modernisation-platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform), or our [user guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/modernisation-platform)

To request an environment, a new feature, or to report a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/issues/new/choose) on our main repo using the relevant issue template.
